Risk Matrix Generator for Cloud Service Models

A web-based tool to generate a risk matrix for cloud service models based on selected risk factors.

Features
- Generates a risk matrix based on selected service model, risk type, impact level, and likelihood level
- Calculates risk score and determines risk level based on impact and likelihood scores
- Provides a simple and intuitive user interface

Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/risk-matrix-generator.git`
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Select service model, risk type, impact level, and likelihood level
4. Click the "Generate Risk Matrix" button to generate the risk matrix

How it Works
1. *Risk Matrix Generation*: The tool generates a risk matrix based on the selected service model, risk type, impact level, and likelihood level.
2. *Risk Score Calculation*: The risk score is calculated by multiplying the impact score and likelihood score.
3. *Risk Level Determination*: The risk level is determined based on the risk score.

Limitations
- This is a basic implementation and real-world risk assessment is much more complex and involves many other factors.
- The tool should not be used for actual risk assessment without proper validation and verification.

Future Development
- Improve the tool to include more risk factors and complex risk assessment logic
- Enhance the user interface to provide more detailed risk analysis and visualization
- Integrate with other risk management tools and frameworks
